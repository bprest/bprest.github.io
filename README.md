## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am an economist specializing in energy and environmental issues, currently serving as a postdoctoral fellow at Resources for the Future (RFF). My interests lie in using econometric tools to understand environmental policy, the changing nature of energy markets, and the interrelationships between them. My recent work considers the implications of the shale revolution for oil and gas markets, intertemporal dynamics of market-based environmental policy under policy uncertainty, and understanding what drives consumer responses to time-of-use electricity pricing.

Before joining RFF, I earned my Ph.D. at Duke University, before which I worked in both the public sector (at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 2009-11) and private sector (at NERA Economic Consulting, 2011-13). At CBO, I developed energy-economic models to analyze the implications of energy and environmental policies, including the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill and renewable electricity standards. At NERA, I conducted electricity market modeling, project valuation, and discounted cash flow analysis of energy and infrastructure investments in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
