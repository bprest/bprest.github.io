I am an economist and Fellow at Resources for the Future specializing in the economics of climate change, energy economics, and oil and gas supply. I use economic theory and econometrics to improve the design of energy and environmental policies. My recent work includes improving the scientific basis of the social cost of carbon and economic modeling of various policies around oil and gas supply.

I earned a PhD from Duke University and previously worked in both the public and private sectors. At the Congressional Budget Office, I developed economic models of various energy sectors to analyze the effects of proposed legislation, including the 2009 Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill and related Clean Electricity Standards. At NERA Economic Consulting, I conducted electricity market modeling, project valuation, and discounted cash flow analysis of various infrastructure investments in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia, with a focus on the power sector.
